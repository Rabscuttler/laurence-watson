I am very excited to be joining the brand new [Energy Systems and Data Analytics (ESDA) Masters course](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bartlett/energy/programmes/energy-systems-and-data-analytics-msc/content) at UCL in the next few weeks. I'm looking to build on my existing skills and develop my learning across the course areas; from energy systems to transport and the built environment. As soon as I saw the course ad tweeted out by UCL Energy Institute I was hooked. 

I've been working in and around energy and climate change since 2010 across several policy areas and there has been a consistent need for data driven analysis and evaluation. Collectively we need to examine all the policy options available, the energy transition pathways, new technologies (quite a lot in there!), the economic and financial context for same and how it all fits together. 

I've learned a lot on my journey so far, but there is no substitute for surrounding yourself with others with similar learning goals in an academic environment. I hope to emerge with a lot more knowledge, a better appreciation for the current landscape of problems and of current research, and with sharpened skills in statistics, programming and machine learning, as well as research methods and writing.

And an honour to join the institution of Jeremy Bentham, Gandhi and my friend Zach Eaton-Rosen. 

Onwards and upwards!
