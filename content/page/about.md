## About

I am an analyst and data scientist. I have spent most of my career working in non-profit think-tanks on energy and climate change, with a side of policy and campaigning.

I worked with [Carbon Tracker](https://carbontracker.org) for two years 2017-2019 as a data scientist focusing on stranded asset risk in the power sector, particularly coal-fired power stations.

Previously I worked in Westminster as a climate and energy policy researcher for [Barry Gardiner MP](https://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/barry-gardiner/146) in his role as Shadow Minister for Energy and Climate Change and as senior parliamentary assistant for [Gill Furniss MP](http://www.parliament.uk/biographies/commons/gill-furniss/4571) in her role as Shadow Minister for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.

Before that I was head of technology at [Sandbag](https://sandbag.org.uk), an NGO focused on carbon markets.

I've also worked at the [Alvin Weinberg Foundation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Alvin_Weinberg_Foundation), a charity advocating the development of next-generation nuclear technology and worked as an intern with [Lord Alf Dubs](https://www.parliament.uk/biographies/lords/lord-dubs/805) and at the British Embassy, Prague.

I have an undergraduate degree in physics from the University of Cambridge and a Masters degree in Energy Systems and Data Analytics from UCL.
