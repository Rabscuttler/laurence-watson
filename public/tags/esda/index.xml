The World Energy Outlook (WEO) is the flagship product of the International Energy Agency (IEA), and one of the most influential energy models worldwide; used by governments, corporations and institutions to assess the changing energy landscape and consider how the future will evolve. In its own words, “the gold standard of energy analysis”. It is a formidable effort and hugely comprehensive.
I will consider the executive summary from WEO 2017, briefly outline the IEA scenarios offered, detail the major energy trends, and question whether the IEA&amp;rsquo;s presentation of its scenarios could be improved.</description>

      <description>I am very excited to be joining the brand new Energy Systems and Data Analytics (ESDA) Masters course at UCL in the next few weeks. I&amp;rsquo;m looking to build on my existing skills and develop my learning across the course areas; from energy systems to transport and the built environment. As soon as I saw the course ad tweeted out by UCL Energy Institute I was hooked.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working in and around energy and climate change since 2010 across several policy areas and there has been a consistent need for data driven analysis and evaluation.</description>
