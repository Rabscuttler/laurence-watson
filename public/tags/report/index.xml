      <description>In December 2017 I co-authored a report with Matt Gray at Carbon Tracker entitled &amp;ldquo;Lignite of the Living Dead: Below 2°C scenario and strategy analysis for EU coal power investors&amp;rdquo;. We found that over half of currently operating coal plants in the EU are losing money, and with some reasonable assumptions around the carbon price and the costs of compliance with new tighter air pollution limits, 97% would be unprofitable by 2030.</description>

      <title>Coal power in the USA</title>

      <description>The first report I co-authored at Carbon Tracker with Matt Gray was called No Country for Coal Gen– Below 2°C and regulatory risk for US coal power owners. We addressed the trends affecting the sector and developed an asset-level phase-out model for coal plants suitable to meet the aims of the Paris Agreement.
We examined how the regulatory framework supports increasingly uncompetitive coal power, and how a phase-out could save US consumers money.</description>
