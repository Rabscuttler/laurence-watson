      <description>About I am an analyst and data scientist. I have spent most of my career working in non-profit think-tanks on energy and climate change, with a side of policy and campaigning.
I worked with Carbon Tracker for two years 2017-2019 as a data scientist focusing on stranded asset risk in the power sector, particularly coal-fired power stations.
Previously I worked in Westminster as a climate and energy policy researcher for Barry Gardiner MP in his role as Shadow Minister for Energy and Climate Change and as senior parliamentary assistant for Gill Furniss MP in her role as Shadow Minister for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.</description>
