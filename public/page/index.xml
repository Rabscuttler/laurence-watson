      <description>About I co-founded Treebeard Technologies with Alex Remedios on the Entrepreneur First accelerator programme. We are making software tools for more reliable, reproducible data science.
I am an analyst and data scientist. I have spent most of my career working in non-profit think-tanks on energy and climate change, with a side of policy and campaigning. I worked with Carbon Tracker for two years 2017-2019 as a data scientist focusing on stranded asset risk in the power sector, particularly coal-fired power stations.</description>
